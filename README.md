# homebrew-digital
Homebrew Computers made with the Digital simulation tool.

## Introduction

These homebrew computer simulations are made with the [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital) simulation tool. See that repo for details getting started.

## Setup

Clone this repo to a local folder.

Copy the files from the `/Digital/lib` folder into the `/common` folder - the `.gitignore` will not post these to the repo. The other common files in that folder will be used in these projects. Then update the "Settings->Library" to point to this new location.
