# Ben Eater's 8-bit Computer from ICs

A re-creation following [Ben Eater's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU) creating the full 8-bit computer using almost exactly the same chips and setup as in the tutorial. The three differences between the tutorial and this project are: 1) The clock was implemented using Digital resources, 2) The EEPROMs were implemented using Digital resources so they could be programmed in Python (see the eeprom_9x8x2.py file), and 3) The 8-bit-to-digital-display was implemented using the dibble-dabble algorithm using Digital components.

The EEPROMs are programmed with the python file `eeprom_9x8x2.py`.
