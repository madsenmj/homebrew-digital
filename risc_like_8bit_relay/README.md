# RISC-Like Relay Project

The goal of this project is to translate the command-based control ideas of the RISC-V architecture into a relay-based CPU. 

Target goals:

* No ICs - the input is simulated through a ROM, but could easily be substituted with a paper or tape drive input
* Program Memory is held by 16-bit words stored in relay registers
* Registers, Logic, and Control are together in the register array
* Output via LEDs but could be updated to paper or tape
